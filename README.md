# Yahtzee Gaming App

Implemented a single-player [Yahtzee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahtzee) game. Yahtzee is a dice game in which the player rolls five dice up to three times in an attempt to achieve various scoring combinations. The player's score is determined by the sum of the values of the dice when a scoring combination is achieved.

The primary objective of this project is to learn to employ various stateful widgets and state-management techniques to implement a non-trivial, single-page application using Flutter.
